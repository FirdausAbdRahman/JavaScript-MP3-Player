JavaScript MP3 Player

I'm doing this project to (of course) enhance my JS skills & for refreshment purpose as it has been a few months since the last time I did some project. It's quite stressful to realise that I had forgotten so many things about Js.

Future updates:  
1. using music API instead of adding music manually.  
2. using framework (ReactJs)
